# Full Stack Vue Web Development: Vue.js, Vuex and Laravel

## Vuebnb

Source code for the Vuebnb project app from the book "Full Stack Vue Web Development: Vue.js, Vuex and Laravel" by Anthony Gore, published by Packt Publishing.

## Chapters

This repository has the required code for chapters 3 through 11 of the book. The state of the code for different chapters has been applied to different branches of the repository.

The **master** branch is the completed project code. The other branches have the initial state of Vuebnb for that particular chapter. For example, branch **ch-03** is the code you'll need at the start of chapter 3. If you want to see the *completed* code for chapter 3, look at branch **ch-04**.

## Checking out a branch

When you clone this code I recommend you checkout the branch of the chapter you're working on. For example, to get the code for chapter 6:

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/vuejsdevelopers/vuebnb.git -b ch-06
```
